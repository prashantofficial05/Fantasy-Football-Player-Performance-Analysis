### Fantasy Football Player Performance Analysis

 **Introduction:**
 
  To analyze and predict player performance in Fantasy Football, focusing on metrics like influence, 
  creativity, goals, assists, and total points. The ultimate goal is to identify cost-effective players, 
  build an optimal team, and explore predictive models for team selection.

**Goal:**
    To analyze player performance metrics, such as influence, creativity, goals, assists, and total 
 points, to identify the best players for building a cost-effective fantasy football team. The project 
 also aims to implement machine learning models for predicting high-performing players.
  
**Description:**

   The project involves analyzing player data to uncover key performance trends and relationships 
    between metrics.
    
 **Key Metrics:** Influence, creativity, goals scored, assists, clean sheets, total points, and cost.
 **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
 **Modeling:** Machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to predict dream team players.
 **Challenges:** Class imbalance in dream team predictions and the need for advanced feature engineering.
     
**Skills:**

  - **Data Analysis:** EDA, correlation analysis, and cost-effectiveness evaluation.
  - **Machine Learning:** Classification models, feature selection, and class imbalance handling.
  - **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  - **Visualization:** Creating dashboards for player performance insights.
    
**Summary:**
     The project identified key performance drivers: influence, creativity, and cost efficiency. High- 
   performing players and cost-effective options were identified for fantasy team selection. The machine 
   learning model achieved an accuracy of 95.38%, but further steps are required to address the class 
   imbalance and improve predictions for dream team players.

**Next Steps:**
  - **Address Class Imbalance:** Use techniques like SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning to improve dream 
     team predictions.
  - **Enhance Features:** Include player form, recent match performance, and team tactics for better 
     predictions.
  - **Advanced Models:** Explore Gradient Boosting and Ensemble Methods for improved classification 
     accuracy.
  - **Visualization:** Develop an interactive dashboard to showcase top player recommendations and 
     performance trends.


**Data Description:**

Key Columns:  now_cost: Current cost of the player.

total_points: Total points scored by the player.

points_per_game: Average points scored per game.

influence: Impact of the player on the game.

creativity: Player's ability to create opportunities.

expected_goals_per_90: Probability of scoring a goal per 90 minutes.

goals_scored: Number of goals scored.

assists: Number of assists provided.

clean_sheets: Number of matches where no goals were conceded.

starts: Total number of matches started.

dream_team: Whether the player is part of the dream team or not.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Distribution of Player Costs:

The majority of players are clustered around a cost range of 40â€“45 with a peak at 45.
The distribution is skewed to the right, indicating a higher concentration of lower-cost players.

Key Summary Statistics:

Cost:
Average: 43.83.
Insight: A significant number of players are priced below the average cost.

Points per game:
Average: 0.38.
Insight: Many players have low point-scoring capabilities.

Goals scored:
Average: 0.006.
Insight: Most players have scored very few goals.

Clean sheets:
Average: 0.048.
Insight: Most players have a low defensive contribution.

**Correlation Insights:**

Goals Scored & Influence (Correlation = 0.77): Players with higher goals scored tend to have a greater influence and total points.

Creativity & Influence (Correlation = 0.47): Players with high creativity often demonstrate strong influence.

Now Cost & Influence (Correlation = -0.08): Players with higher influence may not always be the most expensive.

Key Insights:
Top Performers:
Players in the top 5% of total points are consistently selected in the Dream Team.

Cost Efficiency:
Players with a high points_per_million ratio offer excellent value for cost-effective team-building strategies.

Focus on Key Metrics:
Metrics like influence, creativity, and goals scored have the strongest relationships with total points.
Machine Learning Analysis:

Model: Random Forest Classifier.
Accuracy: 95.38%.

Class Imbalance:
Majority class: Players not in the dream team.
Minority class: Players in the dream team (highly underrepresented).

**Performance:**
Model biased towards the majority class due to imbalance.
High accuracy but poor performance for predicting minority-class players.

**Recommendations:**

For Fantasy Team Selection:
Target Players with High Influence and Creativity:
Focus on players with high influence and creativity metrics

Maximize Points per Cost:
Use the points_per_million metric to identify cost-effective players who maximize team value.

Find Hidden Gems:
Look for lower-cost players with decent influence and creativity who can outperform expectations.
For Machine Learning:

Address Class Imbalance:
Use oversampling techniques like SMOTE or undersample the majority class.
Implement cost-sensitive learning to penalize misclassifications of the minority class.

Enhance Feature Engineering:
Add features like goals per game, assists per game, and combined metrics (e.g., goals + assists).

Explore Advanced Models:
Try Gradient Boosting algorithms or Ensemble Methods for better predictions.

Interpretability:
Focus on feature importance and explainable AI techniques to understand prediction drivers.

For Further Data Collection:
Non-Numerical Features:
Include player form, team performance, and tactical roles.

Additional Metrics:
Team standings, recent match performance, and player injury history.

Proposed Action Plan:
EDA-Based Insights:
Visualize correlations using heatmaps.
Identify clusters of players based on cost and performance metrics using k-means clustering.

Feature Selection:
Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify top features influencing player performance.

Model Validation:
Use precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate minority class performance.

Visualization:
Use Tableau or Matplotlib to create dashboards showcasing player rankings, cost-effectiveness, and performance predictions.
