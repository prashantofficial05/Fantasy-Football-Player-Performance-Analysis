### Fantasy Football Player Performance Analysis

 **Introduction:**
 
  To analyze and predict player performance in Fantasy Football, focusing on metrics like influence, 
  creativity, goals, assists, and total points. The ultimate goal is to identify cost-effective players, 
  build an optimal team, and explore predictive models for team selection.

**Goal:**
    To analyze player performance metrics, such as influence, creativity, goals, assists, and total 
 points, to identify the best players for building a cost-effective fantasy football team. The project 
 also aims to implement machine learning models for predicting high-performing players.
  
**Description:**
    The project involves analyzing player data to uncover key performance trends and relationships 
    between metrics.

 **Key Metrics:** Influence, creativity, goals scored, assists, clean sheets, total points, and cost.
 **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
 **Modeling:** Machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to predict dream team players.
 **Challenges:** Class imbalance in dream team predictions and the need for advanced feature engineering.
     
**Skills:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NLTK, sci-kit-learn)
  - **Data Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, WordCloud)
  - **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

**Skills:**
  - **Data Analysis:** EDA, correlation analysis, and cost-effectiveness evaluation.
  - **Machine Learning:** Classification models, feature selection, and class imbalance handling.
  - **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  - **Visualization:** Creating dashboards for player performance insights.
    
**Summary:**
     The project identified key performance drivers: influence, creativity, and cost efficiency. High- 
   performing players and cost-effective options were identified for fantasy team selection. The machine 
   learning model achieved an accuracy of 95.38%, but further steps are required to address the class 
   imbalance and improve predictions for dream team players.

**Next Steps:**
  - **Address Class Imbalance:** Use techniques like SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning to improve dream 
     team predictions.
  - **Enhance Features:** Include player form, recent match performance, and team tactics for better 
     predictions.
  - **Advanced Models:** Explore Gradient Boosting and Ensemble Methods for improved classification 
     accuracy.
  - **Visualization:** Develop an interactive dashboard to showcase top player recommendations and 
     performance trends.
